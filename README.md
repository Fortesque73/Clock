# Clock

This is a clock that displays the time via terminal, and can handle alarms.
The project has two classes: the Alarm class and the Clock class, which has an empty list of alarms.
The Clock class has some methods like show or showAlarms in order to give the user information about the clock instance.
The Alarm class as well has a time attribute and a ringtone attribute (wich is the default one if not changed). They are changed manually by the user, and the possible new ringtones are meant to be placed in the media file, in mp3 format.

This is still an unfinished project.
